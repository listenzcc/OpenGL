# REGL Application

This project is a simple REGL-based application that demonstrates the use of the REGL library for WebGL rendering.

## Project Structure

```

├── src
│   ├── script.js
├── index.html
└── README.md
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the application.

## Usage

- The application initializes a REGL context and sets up rendering functions.
- The main rendering loop is handled in `src/script.js`.
- You can modify the JavaScript code to change the rendering behavior or add new features.

## Features

- Basic shape rendering using REGL.
- Animation loop for continuous rendering.
- User input handling for interactive features.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser that supports WebGL.
- The REGL library is included via a CDN in the `index.html` file.
